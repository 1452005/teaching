[LifeHabitsChanger: CO2 emission calculator](https://lifehabitschanger.github.io/)  

This visualization allows us to observe the carbon footprint of our choices and lifestyle, at an individual level. We assume that global warming is a fact, and is (in part) caused by too much greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2. We therefore want to raise awareness and inform citizens, by allowing both to calculate its personal CO2 emission (according to several criteria, such as food, transport, heating, ...), but also to simulate different scenarios and to observe the impact of a modification of a habit (if I ate less beef, I would avoid the emission of X kg of CO2). A secondary objective is to simulate habits changes in order to achieve the [COP21](http://www.cop21paris.org/) objective.
