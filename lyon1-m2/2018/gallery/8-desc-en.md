# Project Description

This project consists of making graphs that describe the variation of average temperatures from 1849 to 2013 in the world's major cities. 
The data provided for each city are: date, average temperature of each month, Latitude and Longitude. 
The data is sorted by date. Capital cities (49) Most popular (35).
The project also tries ti shed light on the analysis of CO2 emission as well as the sea level and their relation to the temperature variation in the world.
Globale warming is a true issue that needs to be investigated by newer generations.
